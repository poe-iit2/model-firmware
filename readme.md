Model Firmware
==============

TODO
----

- [ ] Either time-share uart2 or deal with using uart0 (uart1 seems inaccessible)
- [x] LED control per device (also there is a possibility of breaking the LED strips - o two)
- [x] Mock presence sensor (probably just disable presence sensing when mocking)
- [ ] Conform the server data format to the data collected and needed by firmware
- [ ] Make documentation
