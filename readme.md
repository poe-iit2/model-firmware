Model Firmware
==============

TODO
----

1. Either time-share uart2 or deal with using uart0 (uart1 seems inaccessible)
1. LED control per device (also there is a possibility of breaking the LED strips into two)
1. Mock presence sensor (probably just disable presence sensing when mocking)
1. Conform the server data format to the data collected and needed by firmware
1. Make documentation
